	Abstract = {We analyze the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and two-point correlation function of galaxy-size dark matter halos using high-resolution dissipationless simulations of the concordance flat ΛCDM model. The halo samples include both the host halos and the "subhalos," distinct gravitationally bound halos within the virialized regions of larger host systems. We find that the HOD, the probability distribution for a halo of mass M to host a number of subhalos N , is similar to that found in semianalytic and N -body+gasdynamics studies. Its first moment, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} N ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} M , has a complicated shape consisting of a step, a shoulder, and a power-law high-mass tail. The HOD can be described by Poisson statistics at high halo masses but becomes sub-Poisson for ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} N ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} 4. We show that the HOD can be understood as a combination of the probability for a halo of mass M to host a central galaxy and the probability to host a given number N s of satellite galaxies. The former can be approximated by a steplike function, while the latter can be well approximated by a Poisson distribution, fully specified by its first moment. The first moment of the satellite HOD can be well described by a simple power law ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} N s ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} M β with β ≈ 1 for a wide range of number densities, redshifts, and different power spectrum normalizations. This formulation provides a simple but accurate model for the halo occupation distribution found in simulations. At z = 0, the two-point correlation function (CF) of galactic halos can be well fitted by a power law down to ~100 h -1 kpc with an amplitude and slope similar to those of observed galaxies. The dependence of correlation amplitude on the number density of objects is in general agreement with results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. At redshifts z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 1, we find significant departures from the power-law shape of the CF at small scales, where the CF steepens because of a more pronounced one-halo component. The departures from the power law may thus be easier to detect in high-redshift galaxy surveys than at the present-day epoch. They can be used to put useful constraints on the environments and formation of galaxies. If the deviations are as strong as indicated by our results, the assumption of the single power law often used in observational analyses of high-redshift clustering is dangerous and is likely to bias the estimates of the correlation length and slope of the correlation function.},

@article{McCracken07,
	Abstract = {We present measurements of the two-point galaxy angular correlation function w (θ) in the COSMOS field. Independent determinations of w (θ) as a function of magnitude limit are presented for both the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) ACS catalog and also the ground-based data from Subaru and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Despite having significantly different masks, these three determinations agree well. At bright magnitudes ( I AB < 22), our data generally match very well with existing measurements and with mock catalogs based on the semianalytic galaxy formation calculations of Kitzbichler & White (2007 ) from the Millennium Simulation. The exception is that our result is at the upper end of the expected cosmic variance scatter for θ > 10', which we attribute to a particularly rich structure known to exist at z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/simeq.gif] {simeq} 0.8. For fainter samples, however, the level of clustering is somewhat higher than reported by some previous studies; in all three catalogs we find w (θ = 1') ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/simeq.gif] {simeq} 0.014 at a median I AB magnitude of 24. At these very faintest magnitudes, our measurements agree well with the latest determinations from the Canada-France Legacy Survey. This level of clustering is approximately double what is predicted by the semianalytic catalogs (at all angles). The semianalytic results allow an estimate of cosmic variance, which is too small to account for the discrepancy. We therefore conclude that the mean amplitude of clustering at this level is higher than previously estimated.},

	Abstract = {We use the current sample of ~10,000 zCOSMOS spectra of sources selected with I AB < 22.5 to define the density field out to z ~ 1, with much greater resolution in the radial dimension than has been possible with either photometric redshifts or weak lensing. We present the new algorithm that we have developed (ZADE) to incorporate objects not yet observed spectroscopically by modifying their photometric redshift probability distributions using the spectroscopic redshifts of nearby galaxies. We present a number of tests on mock catalogs used to justify this approach. The ZADE algorithm allows us to probe a broader range of galaxy environments and reduce the Poisson noise in the density field. The reconstructed overdensity field of the 10k zCOSMOS galaxies consists of cluster-like patterns surrounded by void-like regions, extending up to z ~ 1. Some of these structures are very large, spanning the ~50 h --1 Mpc transverse direction of the COSMOS field and extending up to Δ z ~ 0.05 in redshift. We present the three-dimensional overdensity maps and compare the reconstructed overdensity field to the independently identified virialized groups of galaxies and clusters detected in the visible and in X-rays. The distribution of the overdense structures is in general well traced by these virialized structures. A comparison of the large-scale structures in the zCOSMOS data and in the mock catalogs reveals an excellent agreement between the fractions of the volume enclosed in structures of all sizes above a given overdensity between the data and the mocks in 0.2 < z < 1, although in the data these overdense regions are in generally larger contiguous structures.},

	Abstract = {We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic sample to constrain the projected radial distribution of satellites around isolated ~ L * galaxies. We employ mock galaxy catalogs derived from high-resolution cosmological simulations to investigate the effects of interloper contamination and show that interlopers significantly bias the estimated slope of the projected radial distribution of satellites. We also show that the distribution of interlopers around galaxies is expected to be nonuniform in velocity space because galaxies are clustered and reside in crowded environments. Successful methods of interloper contamination correction should therefore take into account environments of the host galaxies. Two such new methods are presented, and the most reliable of them is used to correct for interloper contamination in analyses of the SDSS galaxy sample. The best-fit power-law slope of the interloper-corrected surface density distribution of satellites, Σ( R ) ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} R α , in the volume-limited SDSS sample is α ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/simeq.gif] {simeq} -1.7 $\pm$ 0.1, independent of the galaxy and satellite luminosities. Comparison with ΛCDM simulations shows that the radial distribution of the SDSS satellites is more concentrated than that of subhalos around galaxy-sized halos, especially at R < 100 h -1 kpc. The predicted dark matter radial distribution is somewhat more concentrated than the profile of the SDSS satellites, but the difference is not statistically significant for our sample.},

	Abstract = {We present a new proxy for the overdensity peak height for which the large-scale clustering of haloes of a given mass does not vary significantly with the assembly history. The peak height, usually taken to be well represented by the virial mass, can instead be approximated by the mass inside spheres of different radii, which in some cases can be larger than the virial radius and therefore include mass outside the individual host halo. The sphere radii are defined as ? where δt is the age relative to the typical age of galaxies hosted by haloes with virial mass Mvir, Mnl is the non-linear mass, and a= 0.2 and b=-0.02 are the free parameters adjusted to trace the assembly bias effect. Note that r depends on both halo mass and age. In this new approach, some of the objects which were initially considered low-mass peaks (i.e. which had low virial masses) belong to regions with higher overdensities. At large scales, i.e. in the two-halo regime, this model properly recovers the simple prescription where the bias responds to the height of the mass peak alone, in contrast to the usual definition (virial mass) that shows a strong dependence on additional halo properties such as formation time. The dependence on the age in the one-halo term is also remarkably reduced with the new definition. The population of galaxies whose `peak height' changes with this new definition consists mainly of old stellar populations and are preferentially hosted by low-mass haloes located near more massive objects. The latter is in agreement with recent results which indicate that old, low-mass haloes would suffer truncation of mass accretion by nearby larger haloes or simply due to the high density of their surroundings, thus showing an assembly bias effect. The change in mass is small enough that the Sheth et al. mass function is still a good fit to the resulting distribution of new masses.},

	Abstract = {We study an assembly-type bias parametrized by the dimensionless spin parameter that affects massive structures. In numerical simulations, higher spin haloes are more strongly clustered than lower spin haloes of equal mass. We detect a difference of over 30 per cent in the clustering strength for dark matter haloes of (10^13)/h to (10^14)/h M⊙, which is similar to the result of Bett et al. We explore whether the dependence of clustering strength on halo spin is removed if we apply the redefinition of overdensity peak height proposed by Lacerna & Padilla (Paper I) obtained using assembly ages. We find that this is not the case due to two reasons. First, only a few objects of low virial mass are moved into the mass range where the spin introduces an assembly-type bias after using this redefinition. Secondly, this formalism does not alter the mass of massive objects. In other words, the sample of haloes with redefined mass M in the high-mass regime is practically the same as before the redefinition of peak height, and thus the clustering behaviour is the same. We then repeat the process of finding the redefined peak height of Paper I but using the spin. In this case, the new masses show no spin-related assembly bias but they introduce a previously absent assembly bias with respect to relative age. From this result, we conclude that the assembly-type bias with respect to the halo spin has a different origin from that with respect to the assembly age. The former may be due to the material from filaments, which is accreted by massive haloes, and enhanced in high-density environments, thus causing more extreme spin values without significantly changing the formation age of the halo. In addition, the estimates of the mass of collapsed structures in numerical simulations could be lower than the true mass, even in cluster-size haloes. High-mass objects may correspond, in some cases, to a different peak height from that suggested by their virial mass, providing a possible explanation for the assembly-type bias with respect to the spin.

	Abstract = {We analyse galaxies in groups in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and find a weak but significant assembly-type bias, where old central galaxies have a higher clustering amplitude (61 $\pm$ 9 per cent) at scales >1/h Mpc than young central galaxies of equal host halo mass (Mh~(10^11.8)/h M⊙). The observational sample is volume limited out to z = 0.1 with Mr - 5 log (h) ≤ -19.6. We construct a mock catalogue of galaxies that shows a similar signal of assembly bias (46 $\pm$ 9 per cent) at the same halo mass. We then adapt the model presented by Lacerna & Padilla (Paper I) to redefine the overdensity peak height, which traces the assembly bias such that galaxies in equal density peaks show the same clustering regardless of their stellar age, but this time using observational features such as a flux limit. The proxy for peak height, which is proposed as a better alternative than the virial mass, consists in the total mass given by the mass of neighbour host haloes in cylinders centred at each central galaxy. The radius of the cylinder is parameterized as a function of stellar age and virial mass. The best-fitting sets of parameters that make the assembly bias signal lower than 5-15 per cent for both SDSS and mock central galaxies are similar. The idea behind the parameterization is not to minimize the bias, but it is to use this method to understand the physical features that produce the assembly bias effect. Even though the tracers of the density field used here differ significantly from those used in Paper I, our analysis of the simulated catalogue indicates that the different tracers produce correlated proxies, and therefore the reason behind assembly bias is the crowding of peaks in both simulations and the SDSS.},

	Abstract = {We measure the mass function of dark matter halos in a large set of collisionless cosmological simulations of flat
CDM cosmology and investigate its evolution at z < 2. Halos are identified as isolated density peaks, and their masses
are measured within a series of radii enclosing specific overdensities. We argue that these spherical overdensity masses
are more directly linked to cluster observables than masses measured using the friends-of-friends algorithm (FOF), and
are therefore preferable for accurate forecasts of halo abundances. Our simulation set allows us to calibrate the mass
function at z=0 for virial masses in the range (10^11)/h Msun < M < (10^15)/h Msun to <5%, improving on previous results
by a factor of 2--3. We derive fitting functions for the halo mass function in this mass range for a wide range of
overdensities, both at z=0 and earlier epochs. Earlier studies have sought to calibrate a universal mass function, in the
sense that the same functional form and parameters can be used for different cosmologies and redshifts when expressed
in appropriate variables. In addition to our fitting formulae, our main finding is that the mass function cannot be represented
by a universal function at this level or accuracy. The amplitude of the ``universal'' function decreases monotonically
by ~20--50%, depending on the mass definition, from z=0 to 2.5. We also find evidence for redshift
evolution in the overall shape of the mass function.},

Using analytic arguments and N-body simulations, we calculate the mass function and clustering of dark matter halos across a range of redshifts and levels of non-Gaussianity. We propose a simple fitting function for the mass function valid across the entire range of our simulations. We find pronounced effects of non-Gaussianity on the clustering of dark matter halos, leading to strongly scale-dependent bias. This suggests that the large-scale clustering of rare objects may provide a sensitive probe of primordial non-Gaussianity. We very roughly estimate that upcoming surveys can constrain non-Gaussianity at the level of |fNL|≲10, which is competitive with forecasted constraints from the microwave background.},

@article{Zentner07,
	Abstract = {I review the excursion set theory with particular attention toward applications to cold dark matter halo formation and growth, halo abundance, and halo clustering. After a brief introduction to notation and conventions, I begin by recounting the heuristic argument leading to the mass function of bound objects given by Press and Schechter. I then review the more formal derivation of the Press-Schechter halo mass function that makes use of excursion sets of the density field. The excursion set formalism is powerful and can be applied to numerous other problems. I review the excursion set formalism for describing both halo clustering and bias and the properties of void regions. As one of the most enduring legacies of the excursion set approach and one of its most common applications, I spend considerable time reviewing the excursion set theory of halo growth. This section of the review culminates with the description of two Monte Carlo methods for generating ensembles of halo mass accretion histories. In the last section, I emphasize that the standard excursion set approach is the result of several simplifying assumptions. Dropping these assumptions can lead to more faithful predictions and open excursion set theory to new applications. One such assumption is that the height of the barriers that define collapsed objects is a constant function of scale. I illustrate the implementation of the excursion set approach for barriers of arbitrary shape. One such application is the now well-known improvement of the excursion set mass function derived from the "moving" barrier for ellipsoidal collapse. I also emphasize that the statement that halo accretion histories are independent of halo environment in the excursion set approach is not a general prediction of the theory. It is a simplifying assumption. I review the method for constructing correlated random walks of the density field in the more general case. I construct a simple toy model to illustrate that excursion set theory (with a constant barrier height) makes a simple and general prediction for the relation between halo accretion histories and the large-scale environments of halos: regions of high density preferentially contain late-forming halos and conversely for regions of low density. I conclude with a brief discussion of the importance of this prediction relative to recent numerical studies of the environmental dependence of halo properties.},

	Abstract = {We use a very large simulation of structure growth in a Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) universe - the Millennium Simulation - to study assembly bias, the fact that the large-scale clustering of haloes of given mass varies significantly with their assembly history. We extend earlier work based on the same simulation by superposing results for redshifts from 0 to 3, by defining a less noisy estimator of clustering amplitude, and by considering halo concentration, substructure mass fraction and spin, as well as formation time, as additional parameters. These improvements lead to results with less noise than previous studies and covering a wider range of halo masses and structural properties. We find significant and significantly different assembly bias effects for all the halo properties we consider, although in all cases the dependencies on halo mass and on redshift are adequately described as a dependence on equivalent peak height ν(M, z). The ν-dependencies for different halo properties differ qualitatively and are not related as might naively be expected given the relations between formation time, concentration, substructure fraction and spin found for the halo population as a whole. These results suggest that it will be difficult to build models for the galaxy populations of dark haloes which can robustly relate the amplitude of large-scale galaxy clustering to that for mass clustering at better than the 10 per cent level.},

@article{Croton07,
	Abstract = {The clustering of dark haloes depends not only on their mass but also on their assembly history, a dependence we term `assembly bias'. Using a galaxy formation model grafted on to the Millennium Simulation of the ΛCDM cosmogony, we study how assembly bias affects galaxy clustering. We compare the original simulation to `shuffled' versions where the galaxy populations are randomly swapped among haloes of similar mass, thus isolating the effects of correlations between assembly history and environment at fixed mass. Such correlations are ignored in the halo occupation distribution models often used populate dark matter simulations with galaxies, but they are significant in our more realistic simulation. Assembly bias enhances two-point correlations by 10 per cent for galaxies with brighter than -17, but suppresses them by a similar amount for galaxies brighter than -20. When such samples are split by colour, assembly bias is 5 per cent stronger for red galaxies and 5 per cent weaker for blue ones. Halo central galaxies are differently affected by assembly bias than are galaxies of all types. It almost doubles the correlation amplitude for faint red central galaxies. Shuffling galaxies among haloes of fixed formation redshift or concentration in addition to fixed mass produces biases which are not much smaller than when mass alone is fixed. Assembly bias must reflect a correlation of environment with aspects of halo assembly which are not encoded in either of these parameters. It induces effects which could compromise precision measurements of cosmological parameters from large galaxy surveys.},

@article{Wechsler06,
	Abstract = {We investigate the dependence of dark matter halo clustering on halo formation time, density profile concentration, and subhalo occupation number, using high-resolution numerical simulations of a ΛCDM cosmology. We confirm results that halo clustering is a function of halo formation time at fixed mass and that this trend depends on halo mass. For the first time, we show unequivocally that halo clustering is a function of halo concentration and show that the dependence of halo bias on concentration, mass, and redshift can be accurately parameterized in a simple way: b(M,c|z) = b(M|z)b(c|M/M⋆). Interestingly, the scaling between bias and concentration changes sign with the value of M/M⋆: high-concentration (early forming) objects cluster more strongly for M ≲ M⋆, while low-concentration (late forming) objects cluster more strongly for rare high-mass halos, M ≳ M⋆. We show the first explicit demonstration that host dark halo clustering depends on the halo occupation number (of dark matter subhalos) at fixed mass and discuss implications for halo model calculations of dark matter power spectra and galaxy clustering statistics. The effect of these halo properties on clustering is strongest for early-forming dwarf-mass halos, which are significantly more clustered than typical halos of their mass. Our results suggest that isolated low-mass galaxies (e.g., low surface brightness dwarfs) should have more slowly rising rotation curves than their more clustered counterparts and may have consequences for the dearth of dwarf galaxies in voids. They also imply that self-calibrating richness-selected cluster samples with their clustering properties might overestimate cluster masses and bias cosmological parameter estimation.},

	Abstract = {We present an evolutionary model for starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies in which mergers between gas-rich galaxies drive nuclear inflows of gas, producing starbursts and feeding the buried growth of supermassive black holes (BHs) until feedback expels gas and renders a briefly visible optical quasar. The quasar lifetime and obscuring column density depend on both the instantaneous and peak quasar luminosity, and we determine this dependence using a large set of galaxy merger simulations varying galaxy properties, orbital geometry, and gas physics. We use these fits to deconvolve observed quasar luminosity functions and obtain the evolution of the formation rate of quasars with peak luminosity, img1.gif(Lpeak, z). Quasars spend extended periods at luminosities well below peak, so img1.gif(Lpeak) has a maximum corresponding to the "break" in the observed luminosity function. From img1.gif(Lpeak) and our simulations, we obtain self-consistent hard and soft X-ray and optical luminosity functions and predict many observables at multiple redshifts, including column density distributions of optical and X-ray samples, the luminosity function of broad-line quasars in X-ray samples and broad-line fraction versus luminosity, active BH mass functions, the distribution of Eddington ratios, the mass function of relic BHs and total BH mass density, and the cosmic X-ray background. In every case, our predictions agree well with observed estimates, without invoking ad hoc assumptions about source properties or distributions.

	Abstract = {NEARBY clusters of galaxies are filled with red elliptical 'E' and lenticular 'SO' galaxies1, while younger clusters (at redshifts of >~ 0.4) contain substantial populations of blue spiral galaxies with morphological peculiarities. Thus, within the last 4-5 billion years, galaxies in clusters underwent strong evolution that completely changed their character. By contrast, galaxies that are not associated with clusters show far less morphological evolution8. Here we propose that multiple highspeed encounters between galaxies---`galaxy harassment'---drives the morphological evolution in clusters. Our simulations show that these encounters are very different from mergers; they transform small disk galaxies into dwarf elliptical or dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Harassment will leave detectable debris arcs and could provide fuel for quasars in sub-luminous host galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We study the thermal formation history of four simulated galaxies that were shown by Naab et al. to reproduce a number of observed properties of elliptical galaxies. The temperature of the gas in the galaxies is steadily increasing with decreasing redshift, although much of the gas has a cooling time shorter than the Hubble time. The gas is being heated and kept hot by gravitational heating processes through the release of potential energy from infalling stellar clumps. The energy is dissipated in supersonic collisions of infalling gas lumps with the ambient gas and through the dynamical capturing of satellite systems causing gravitational wakes that transfer energy to the surrounding gas. Furthermore, dynamical friction from the infalling clumps pushes out dark matter (DM), lowering the central DM density by up to a factor of 2 from z = 3 to z = 0. In galaxies in which the late formation history ( z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 2) is dominated by minor merging and accretion, the energy released ( E ~ 5 × 10 59 erg) from gravitational feedback is sufficient to form red and dead elliptical galaxies by z ~ 1 even in the absence of supernova and AGN feedback.},

	Abstract = {We address the origin of the robust bimodality observed in galaxy properties about a characteristic stellar mass ~3 × 1010Msolar. Less massive galaxies tend to be ungrouped blue star forming discs, while more massive galaxies are typically grouped red old-star spheroids. Colour-magnitude data show a gap between the red and blue sequences, extremely red luminous galaxies already at z~ 1, a truncation of today's blue sequence above L*, and massive starbursts at z~ 2-4. We propose that these features are driven by the thermal properties of the inflowing gas and their interplay with the clustering and feedback processes, all functions of the dark matter halo mass and associated with a similar characteristic scale. In haloes below a critical shock-heating mass Mshock<~ 1012Msolar, discs are built by cold streams, not heated by a virial shock, yielding efficient early star formation. It is regulated by supernova feedback into a long sequence of bursts in blue galaxies constrained to a `fundamental line'. Cold streams penetrating through hot media in M>=Mshock haloes preferentially at z>= 2 lead to massive starbursts in L > L* galaxies. At z < 2, in M > Mshock haloes hosting groups, the gas is heated by a virial shock, and being dilute it becomes vulnerable to feedback from energetic sources such as active galactic nuclei. This shuts off gas supply and prevents further star formation, leading by passive evolution to `red-and-dead' massive spheroids starting at z~ 1. A minimum in feedback efficiency near Mshock explains the observed minimum in M/L and the qualitative features of the star formation history. The cold flows provide a hint for solving the angular momentum problem. When these processes are incorporated in simulations they recover the main bimodality features and solve other open puzzles.},

	Abstract = {A model of galaxy formation is developed in which dissipation plays a role along with purely gravitational processes. The gist of the model is that the distribution of the dominant mass component on all scales arises from purely gravitational clustering, while the observed sizes and luminosity functions of galaxies are determined by gas-dynamical dissipative processes. The model accounts for the large amount of nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80% or more of the virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies. On certain specific assumptions, a luminosity function is derived that agrees reasonably well with observation.},

	Abstract = {Satellite galaxies in groups and clusters are more likely to have low star formation rates (SFRs) and lie on the `red sequence' than central (`field') galaxies. Using galaxy group/cluster catalogues from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, together with a high-resolution, cosmological N-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the star formation histories and quenching time-scales of satellites of Mstar > 5 × 109 M⊙ at z ≈ 0. We first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessing and ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and properly accounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z ˜ 0.5, or ˜5 Gyr ago. To obtain accurate initial conditions for the SFRs of satellites at their time of first infall, we construct an empirical parametrization for the evolution of central galaxy SFRs and quiescent fractions. With this, we constrain the importance and efficiency of satellite quenching as a function of satellite and host halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominant process for building up all quiescent galaxies at Mstar < 1010 M⊙. We then constrain satellite star formation histories, finding a `delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario: satellite SFRs evolve unaffected for 2-4 Gyr after infall, after which star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of <0.8 Gyr. These quenching time-scales are shorter for more massive satellites but do not depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in the satellite quiescent fraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites quenching in a lower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing), which is responsible for up to half of quenched satellites in massive clusters. Because of the long time delay before quenching starts, satellites experience significant stellar mass growth after infall, nearly identical to central galaxies. This fact provides key physical insight into the subhalo abundance matching method.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the clustering of red and blue galaxies from four samples spanning a redshift range of 0.4 < z < 2.0 to test the various scenarios by which galaxies evolve onto the red sequence. The data are taken from the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey, DEEP2, and COMBO-17. The use of clustering allows us to determine what fraction of the red sequence is made up of central galaxies and satellite galaxies. At all redshifts, including z = 0, the data are consistent with ~60% of satellite galaxies being red or quenched, implying that ~1/3 of the red sequence is comprised of satellite galaxies. More than three-fourths of red satellite galaxies were moved to the red sequence after they were accreted onto a larger halo. The constant fraction of satellite galaxies that are red yields a quenching time for satellite galaxies that depends on redshift in the same way as halo dynamical times: t Q ~ (1 + z ) --1.5 . In three of the four samples, the data favor a model in which red central galaxies are a random sample of all central galaxies; there is no preferred halo mass scale at which galaxies make the transition from star-forming to red and dead. The large errors on the fourth sample inhibit any conclusions. Theoretical models in which star formation is quenched above a critical halo mass are excluded by these data. A scenario in which mergers create red central galaxies imparts a weaker correlation between halo mass and central galaxy color, but even the merger scenario creates tension with red galaxy clustering at redshifts above 0.5. These results suggest that the mechanism by which central galaxies become red evolves from z = 0.5 to z = 0.},

	Abstract = {We use a complete sample of galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to study how structure, star formation and nuclear activity depend on local density and on stellar mass. Local density is estimated by counting galaxies above a fixed absolute magnitude limit within cylinders 2 Mpc in projected radius and +/-500 km s-1 in depth. The stellar mass distribution of galaxies shifts by almost a factor of two towards higher masses between low- and high-density regions. At fixed stellar mass both star formation and nuclear activity depend strongly on local density, while structural parameters such as size and concentration are almost independent of it. Only for low-mass galaxies (M* < 3 × 10^10 Msolar, where M*= stellar mass) do we find a weak shift towards greater concentration and compactness in the highest-density regions. The galaxy property most sensitive to environment is specific star formation rate (SFR). For galaxies with stellar masses in the range 10^10 to 3 × 10^10 Msolar, the median SFR/M* decreases by more than a factor of 10 as the population shifts from predominantly star-forming at low densities to predominantly inactive at high densities. This decrease is less marked, but still significant, for high-mass galaxies. Galaxy properties that are associated with star formation correlate strongly with local density. At fixed stellar mass twice as many galaxies host active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with strong [OIII] emission in low-density regions as in high. Massive galaxies in low-density environments also contain more dust. To gain insight into the processes that shut down star formation, we analyse correlations between spectroscopic indicators that probe the star formation history (SFH) on different time-scales: the λ4000 break strength, the Balmer-absorption index HδA, and the specific SFR/M*. The correlations between these indicators do not depend on environment, suggesting that the decrease in star formation activity in dense environments occurs over long (>1-Gyr) time-scales. Since structure does not depend on environment for galaxies with masses greater than 3 × 10^10 Msolar, the trends in recent SFH, dust and nuclear activity in these systems cannot be driven by processes that alter structure, for example mergers or harassment. The SFH-density correlation is strongest for small-scale estimates of local density. We see no evidence that star formation history depends on environment more than 1 Mpc from a galaxy. Finally, we highlight a striking similarity between the changes in the galaxy population as a function of density and as a function of redshift. We use mock catalogues derived from N-body simulations to explain how this may be understood.},

	Abstract = {We analyse the observed correlation between galaxy environment and Hα emission-line strength, using volume-limited samples and group catalogues of 24 968 galaxies at 0.05 < z < 0.095, drawn from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (MbJ< -19.5) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Mr < -20.6). We characterize the environment by: (1) Σ5, the surface number density of galaxies determined by the projected distance to the fifth nearest neighbour; and (2) ρ1.1 and ρ5.5, three-dimensional density estimates obtained by convolving the galaxy distribution with Gaussian kernels of dispersion 1.1 and 5.5 Mpc, respectively. We find that star-forming and quiescent galaxies form two distinct populations, as characterized by their Hα equivalent width, W0(Hα). The relative numbers of star-forming and quiescent galaxies vary strongly and continuously with local density. However, the distribution of W0(Hα) amongst the star-forming population is independent of environment. The fraction of star-forming galaxies shows strong sensitivity to the density on large scales, ρ5.5, which is likely independent of the trend with local density, ρ1.1. We use two differently selected group catalogues to demonstrate that the correlation with galaxy density is approximately independent of group velocity dispersion, for σ= 200-1000 km s-1. Even in the lowest-density environments, no more than ~70 per cent of galaxies show significant Hα emission. Based on these results, we conclude that the present-day correlation between star formation rate and environment is a result of short-time-scale mechanisms that take place preferentially at high redshift, such as starbursts induced by galaxy-galaxy interactions.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the u - r color distribution of 24,346 galaxies with M r ≤ -18 and z < 0.08, drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey first data release, as a function of luminosity and environment. The color distribution is well fitted with two Gaussian distributions, which we use to divide the sample into a blue and red population. At fixed luminosity, the mean color of the blue (red) distribution is nearly independent of environment, with a weakly significant (~3 σ) detection of a trend for colors to become redder by 0.1-0.14 (0.03-0.06) mag with a factor of ~100 increase in local density, as characterized by the surface density of galaxies within a $\pm$1000 km s -1 redshift slice. In contrast, at fixed luminosity the fraction of galaxies in the red distribution is a strong function of local density, increasing from ~10%-30% of the population in the lowest density environments to ~70% at the highest densities. The strength of this trend is similar for both the brightest (-23 < M r < -22) and faintest (-19 < M r < -18) galaxies in our sample. The fraction of red galaxies within the virialized regions of clusters shows no significant dependence on velocity dispersion. Even at the lowest densities explored, a substantial population of red galaxies exists, which might be fossil groups. We propose that most star-forming galaxies today evolve at a rate that is determined primarily by their intrinsic properties and independent of their environment. Any environmentally triggered transformations from blue to red colors must occur either on a short timescale or preferentially at high redshift to preserve the simple Gaussian nature of the color distribution. The mechanism must be effective for both bright and faint galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the bivariate distribution, in color versus absolute magnitude (u-r vs. Mr), of a low-redshift sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (2400 deg2, 0.004 < z < 0.08, -23.5 < Mr < -15.5). We trace the bimodality of the distribution from luminous to faint galaxies by fitting double Gaussians to the color functions separated in absolute magnitude bins. Color-magnitude (CM) relations are obtained for red and blue distributions (early- and late-type, predominantly field, galaxies) without using any cut in morphology. Instead, the analysis is based on the assumption of normal Gaussian distributions in color. We find that the CM relations are well fitted by a straight line plus a tanh function. Both relations can be described by a shallow CM trend (slopes of about -0.04, -0.05) plus a steeper transition in the average galaxy properties over about 2 mag. The midpoints of the transitions (Mr = -19.8 and -20.8 for the red and blue distributions, respectively) occur around 2 × 1010 Script M☉ after converting luminosities to stellar mass. Separate luminosity functions are obtained for the two distributions. The red distribution has a more luminous characteristic magnitude and a shallower faint-end slope (M* = -21.5, α = -0.8) compared to the blue distribution (α ≈ -1.3, depending on the parameterization). These are approximately converted to galaxy stellar mass functions. The red distribution galaxies have a higher number density per magnitude for masses greater than about 3 × 1010 Script M☉. Using a simple merger model, we show that the differences between the two functions are consistent with the red distribution being formed from major galaxy mergers.},

	Abstract = {We develop a new method to constrain the star formation histories, dust attenuation and stellar masses of galaxies. It is based on two stellar absorption-line indices, the 4000-{\AA} break strength and the Balmer absorption-line index HδA. Together, these indices allow us to constrain the mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed in bursts over the past few Gyr. A comparison with broad-band photometry then yields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. We generate a large library of Monte Carlo realizations of different star formation histories, including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. We use this library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions, dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios for a sample of 122808 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The typical 95 per cent confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is +/-40 per cent. We study how the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolute magnitude, concentration index and photometric passband and how dust attenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000-{\AA} break strength. We also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present Universe is distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration, colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. We find that most of the stellar mass in the local Universe resides in galaxies that have, to within a factor of approximately 2, stellar masses ~5× 1010Msolar, half-light radii ~3 kpc and half-light surface mass densities ~109 Msolar kpc-2. The distribution of Dn(4000) is strongly bimodal, showing a clear division between galaxies dominated by old stellar populations and galaxies with more recent star formation.},

	Abstract = {Using photometry and spectroscopy of 183,487 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we present bivariate distributions of pairs of seven galaxy properties: four optical colors, surface brightness, radial profile shape as measured by the S{\'e}rsic index, and absolute magnitude. In addition, we present the dependence of local galaxy density (smoothed on 8 h -1 Mpc scales) on all of these properties. Several classic, well-known relations among galaxy properties are evident at extremely high signal-to-noise ratio: the color-color relations of galaxies, the color-magnitude relations, the magnitude-surface brightness relation, and the dependence of density on color and absolute magnitude. We show that most of the i -band luminosity density in the universe is in the absolute magnitude and surface brightness ranges used: -23.5 < M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/594/1/186/img1.gif] {img1.gif} < -17.0 mag and 17 < μ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/594/1/186/img1.gif] {img1.gif} < 24 mag in 1 arcsec 2 [the notation z b represents the b band shifted blueward by a factor (1 + z )]. Some of the relationships between parameters, in particular the color-magnitude relations, show stronger correlations for exponential galaxies and concentrated galaxies taken separately than for all galaxies taken together. We provide a simple set of fits of the dependence of galaxy properties on luminosity for these two sets of galaxies and other quantitative details of our results.},

	Abstract = {We study the optical colors of 147,920 galaxies brighter than g * = 21, observed in five bands by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) over ~100 deg 2 of high Galactic latitude sky along the celestial equator. The distribution of galaxies in the g *- r * versus u *- g * color-color diagram is strongly bimodal, with an optimal color separator of u *- r * = 2.22. We use visual morphology and spectral classification of subsamples of 287 and 500 galaxies, respectively, to show that the two peaks correspond roughly to early- (E, S0, and Sa) and late-type (Sb, Sc, and Irr) galaxies, as expected from their different stellar populations. We also find that the colors of galaxies are correlated with their radial profiles, as measured by the concentration index and by the likelihoods of exponential and de Vaucouleurs' profile fits. While it is well known that late-type galaxies are bluer than early-type galaxies, this is the first detection of a local minimum in their color distribution. In all SDSS bands, the counts versus apparent magnitude relations for the two color types are significantly different and demonstrate that the fraction of blue galaxies increases toward the faint end.},

	Abstract = {We use the halo occupation model to calibrate galaxy group finders in magnitude limited redshift surveys. Because, according to the current scenario of structure formation, galaxy groups are associated with cold dark matter (CDM) haloes, we make use of the properties of the halo population in the design of our group finder. The method starts with an assumed mass-to-light ratio to assign a tentative mass to each group. This mass is used to estimate the size and velocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turn is used to determine group membership (in redshift space). This procedure is repeated until no further changes occur in group memberships. We find that the final groups selected this way are insensitive to the mass-to-light ratio assumed. We use mock catalogues, constructed using the conditional luminosity function (CLF), to test the performance of our group finder in terms of completeness of true members and contamination by interlopers. Our group finder is more successful than the conventional friends-of-friends (FOF) group finder in assigning galaxies in common dark matter haloes to a single group. We apply our group finder to the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and compare the resulting group properties with model predictions based on the CLF. For the ΛCDM concordance cosmology, we find a clear discrepancy between the model and data in the sense that the model predicts too many rich groups. In order to match the observational results, we have to either increase the mass-to-light ratios of rich clusters to a level significantly higher than current observational estimates, or to assume σ8~= 0.7, compared with the concordance value of 0.9.},

	Abstract = {We introduce the Illustris Project, a series of large-scale hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. The highest resolution simulation, Illustris-1, covers a volume of (106.5 Mpc)3, has a dark mass resolution of 6.26 × 106 M⊙, and an initial baryonic matter mass resolution of 1.26 × 106 M⊙. At z = 0 gravitational forces are softened on scales of 710 pc, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells have an extent of 48 pc. We follow the dynamical evolution of 2 × 18203 resolution elements and in addition passively evolve 18203 Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle count of more than 18 billion. The galaxy formation model includes: primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic nuclei. Here we describe the simulation suite, and contrast basic predictions of our model for the present-day galaxy population with observations of the local universe. At z = 0 our simulation volume contains about 40 000 well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular galaxies. The simulation reproduces reasonably well the cosmic star formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon conversion efficiency at z = 0. It also qualitatively captures the impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disc galaxies obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime, the simulation reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei.},

	Abstract = {Comparisons between observational surveys and galaxy formation models find that dark matter haloes' mass can largely explain their galaxies' stellar mass. However, it remains uncertain whether additional environmental variables, known as assembly bias, are necessary to explain other galaxy properties. We use the Illustris simulation to investigate the role of assembly bias in producing galactic conformity by considering 18 000 galaxies with Mstellar > 2 × 10^9 M⊙. We find a significant signal of galactic conformity: out to distances of about 10 Mpc, the mean red fraction of galaxies around redder galaxies is higher than around bluer galaxies at fixed stellar mass. Dark matter haloes exhibit an analogous conformity signal, in which the fraction of haloes formed at earlier times (old haloes) is higher around old haloes than around younger ones at fixed halo mass. A plausible interpretation of galactic conformity is the combination of the halo conformity signal with the galaxy colour--halo age relation: at fixed stellar mass, particularly towards the low-mass end, Illustris' galaxy colours correlate with halo age, with the reddest galaxies (often satellites) preferentially found in the oldest haloes. We explain the galactic conformity effect with a simple semi-empirical model, assigning stellar mass via halo mass (abundance matching) and galaxy colour via halo age (age matching). Regarding comparison to observations, we conclude that the adopted selection/isolation criteria, projection effects, and stacking techniques can have a significant impact on the measured amplitude of the conformity signal.},

	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the physical properties of ~ 10^5 galaxies with measurable star formation in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z < 0.2. We develop a method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be 1.915+0.02-0.01 (random)+0.14-0.42 (systematic) h_70 10^(-2) Msolar yr^(-1) Mpc^(-3) at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (10^10 to 10^11 Msolar), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* > 10^10 Msolar. The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408+0.005-0.002 (random)+0.029-0.090 (systematic) h^(-1). We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of 7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-{\AA}break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We compute photometric redshifts in the fourth public release of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. This unique multi-colour catalogue comprises u*, g', r', i', z' photometry in four deep fields of 1 deg2 each and 35 deg2 distributed over three wide fields. 
Methods: We used a template-fitting method to compute photometric redshifts calibrated with a large catalogue of 16 983 high-quality spectroscopic redshifts from the VVDS-F02, VVDS-F22, DEEP2, and the zCOSMOS surveys. The method includes correction of systematic offsets, template adaptation, and the use of priors. We also separated stars from galaxies using both size and colour information. 
Results: Comparing with galaxy spectroscopic redshifts, we find a photometric redshift dispersion, σΔ z/(1+z_s), of 0.028-0.30 and an outlier rate, |Δ z| ≥ 0.15× (1+z_s), of 3-4% in the deep field at i'_AB < 24. In the wide fields, we find a dispersion of 0.037-0.039 and an outlier rate of 3-4% at i'_AB < 22.5. Beyond i'_AB = 22.5 in the wide fields the number of outliers rises from 5% to 10% at i'_AB < 23 and i'_AB < 24, respectively. For the wide sample the systematic redshift bias stays below 1% to i'_AB < 22.5, whereas we find no significant bias in the deep fields. We investigated the effect of tile-to-tile photometric variations and demonstrated that the accuracy of our photometric redshifts is reduced by at most 21%. Application of our star-galaxy classifier reduced the contamination by stars in our catalogues from 60% to 8% at i'_AB < 22.5 in our field with the highest stellar density while keeping a complete galaxy sample. Our CFHTLS T0004 photometric redshifts are distributed to the community. Our release includes 592891 (i'_AB < 22.5) and 244701 (i'_AB < 24) reliable galaxy photometric redshifts in the wide and deep fields, respectively.

	Abstract = {Void regions of the Universe offer a special environment for studying cosmology and galaxy formation, which may expose weaknesses in our understanding of these phenomena. Although galaxies in voids are observed to be predominately gas rich, star forming and blue, a subpopulation of bright-red void galaxies can also be found, whose star formation was shutdown long ago. Are the same processes that quench star formation in denser regions of the Universe also at work in voids?
We compare the luminosity function of void galaxies in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, to those from a galaxy formation model built on the Millennium simulation. We show that a global star formation suppression mechanism in the form of low-luminosity `radio-mode' active galactic nuclei (AGN) heating is sufficient to reproduce the observed population of void early types. Radio-mode heating is environment independent other than its dependence on dark matter halo mass, where, above a critical mass threshold of approximately Mvir ~ 10^12.5 Msolar, gas cooling on to the galaxy is suppressed and star formation subsequently fades. In the Millennium simulation, the void halo mass function is shifted with respect to denser environments, but still maintains a high-mass tail above this critical threshold. In such void haloes, radio-mode heating remains efficient and red galaxies are found; collectively these galaxies match the observed space density without any modification to the model. Consequently, galaxies living in vastly different large-scale environments but hosted by haloes of similar mass are predicted to have similar properties, consistent with observations.},

	Abstract = {We simulate the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes by implementing a suite of semi-analytic models on the output of the Millennium Run, a very large simulation of the concordance Λ cold dark matter cosmogony. Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to be successful.},

	Abstract = {We explore the redshift evolution of a curious correlation between the star formation properties of central galaxies and their satellites (`galactic conformity') at intermediate to high redshift (0.4 < z < 1.9). Using an extremely deep near-infrared survey, we study the distribution and properties of satellite galaxies with stellar masses, log(M*/M⊙) > 9.7, around central galaxies at the characteristic Schechter function mass, M ˜ M*. We fit the radial profiles of satellite number densities with simple power laws, finding slopes in the range -1.1 to -1.4 for mass-selected satellites, and -1.3 to -1.6 for passive satellites. We confirm the tendency for passive satellites to be preferentially located around passive central galaxies at 3σ significance and show that it exists to at least z ˜ 2. Meanwhile, the quenched fraction of satellites around star-forming galaxies is consistent with field galaxies of equal stellar masses. We find no convincing evidence for a redshift-dependent evolution of these trends. One simple interpretation of these results is that only passive central galaxies occupy an environment that is capable of independently shutting off star formation in satellite galaxies. By examining the satellites of higher stellar mass star-forming galaxies (log(M*/M⊙) > 11), we conclude that the origin of galactic conformity is unlikely to be exclusively due to the host dark matter halo mass. A halo-mass-independent correlation could be established by either formation bias or a more physical connection between central and satellite star formation histories. For the latter, we argue that a star formation (or active galactic nucleus) related outburst event from the central galaxy could establish a hot halo environment which is then capable of quenching both central and satellite galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Quenched central galaxies tend to reside in a preferentially quenched large-scale environment, a phenomenon that has been dubbed galactic conformity. Remarkably, this tendency persists out to scales far larger than the virial radius of the halo hosting the central. Therefore, conformity manifestly violates the widely adopted assumption that the dark matter halo mass Mvir exclusively governs galaxy occupation statistics. This paper is the first in a series studying the implications of the observed conformity signal for the galaxy--dark matter connection. We show that recent measurements of conformity on scales r ∼ 1--5 Mpc imply that central galaxy quenching statistics cannot be correctly predicted with the knowledge of Mvir alone. We also demonstrate that ejected (or `backsplash') satellites cannot give rise to the signal. We then invoke the age matching model, which is predicated on the co-evolution of galaxies and haloes. We find that this model produces a strong signal, and that central galaxies are solely responsible. We conclude that large-scale `two-halo' conformity represents a smoking gun of central galaxy assembly bias, and indicates that contemporary models of satellite quenching have systematically overestimated the influence of post-infall processes.},

	Abstract = {Correlations between the star formation rates (SFRs) of nearby galaxies (so-called galactic conformity) have been observed for projected separations up to 4 Mpc, an effect not predicted by current semi-analytic models. We investigate correlations between the mass accretion rates (dMvir/dt) of nearby halos as a potential physical origin for this effect. We find that pairs of host halos "know about" each others' assembly histories even when their present-day separation is greater than thirty times the virial radius of either halo. These distances are far too large for direct interaction between the halos to explain the correlation in their dMvir/dt. Instead, halo pairs at these distances reside in the same large-scale tidal environment, which regulates dMvir/dt for both halos. Larger halos are less affected by external forces, which naturally gives rise to a mass dependence of the halo conformity signal. SDSS measurements of galactic conformity exhibit a qualitatively similar dependence on stellar mass, including how the signal varies with distance. Based on the expectation that halo accretion and galaxy SFR are correlated, we predict the scale-, mass- and redshift-dependence of large-scale galactic conformity, finding that the signal should drop to undetectable levels by z > 1. These predictions are testable with current surveys to z ~ 1; confirmation would establish a strong correlation between dark matter halo accretion rate and central galaxy SFR.},

	Abstract = {We present age distribution matching, a theoretical formalism for predicting how galaxies of luminosity L and colour C occupy dark matter haloes. Our model supposes that there are just two fundamental properties of a halo that determine the colour and brightness of the galaxy it hosts: the maximum circular velocity Vmax and the redshift zstarve that correlates with the epoch at which the star formation in the galaxy ceases. The halo property zstarve is intended to encompass physical characteristics of halo mass assembly that may deprive the galaxy of its cold gas supply and, ultimately, quench its star formation. The new, defining feature of the model is that, at fixed luminosity, galaxy colour is in monotonic correspondence with zstarve, with the larger values of zstarve being assigned redder colours. We populate an N-body simulation with a mock galaxy catalogue based on age distribution matching and show that the resulting mock galaxy distribution accurately describes a variety of galaxy statistics. Our model suggests that halo and galaxy assembly are indeed correlated. We make publicly available our low-redshift, Sloan Digital Sky Survey Mr < -19 mock galaxy catalogue, and main progenitor histories of all z = 0 haloes, at http://logrus.uchicago.edu/~aphearin},

@article{Kauffmann15,
	Abstract = {Two explanations have been put forward to explain the observed conformity between the colours and specific star formation rates (SFR/M*) of galaxies on large scales: (1) the formation times of their surrounding dark matter haloes are correlated (commonly referred to as `assembly bias'), (2) gas is heated over large scales at early times, leading to coherent modulation of cooling and star formation between well-separated galaxies (commonly referred to as `pre-heating'). To distinguish between the pre-heating and assembly bias scenarios, we search for relics of energetic feedback events in the neighbourhood of central galaxies with different specific SFRs. We find a significant excess of very high mass (log M* > 11.3) galaxies out to a distance of 2.5 Mpc around low SFR/M* central galaxies compared to control samples of higher SFR/M* central galaxies with the same stellar mass and redshift. We also find that very massive galaxies in the neighbourhood of low-SFR/M* galaxies have much higher probability of hosting radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). The radio-loud AGN fraction in neighbours with log M* > 11.3 is four times higher around passive, non star-forming centrals at projected distances of 1 Mpc and two times higher at projected distances of 4 Mpc. Finally, we carry out an investigation of conformity effects in the recently publicly released Illustris cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, which includes energetic input both from quasars and from radio mode accretion on to black holes. We do not find conformity effects of comparable amplitude on large scales in the simulations and we propose that gas needs to be pushed out of dark matter haloes more efficiently at high redshifts.},

@article{Kauffmann13,
	Abstract = {The observed correlation between star formation in central galaxies and in their neighbours (a phenomenon dubbed `galactic conformity') is in need of a convincing physical explanation. To gain further insight, we use a volume-limited sample of galaxies with redshifts less than 0.03 drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 to investigate the scale dependence of the effect and how it changes as a function of the mass of the central galaxy. Conformity extends over a central galaxy stellar mass range spanning two orders of magnitude. The scale dependence and the precise nature of the effect depend on the mass of the central. In central galaxies with masses less than 1010 M⊙, conformity extends out to scales in excess of 4 Mpc, well beyond the virial radii of their dark matter haloes. For low-mass central galaxies, conformity with neighbours on very large scales is only seen when they have low star formation rate or gas content. In contrast, at high stellar masses, conformity with neighbours applies in the gas-rich regime and is clearly confined to scales comparable to the virial radius of the dark matter halo of the central galaxy. Our analysis of a mock catalogue from the Guo et al. semi-analytic models shows that conformity-like effects arise because gas-poor satellite galaxies are sometimes misclassified as centrals. However, the effects in the models are much weaker than observed. Misclassification only influences the low-end tail of the SFR/M* distribution of neighbouring galaxies at large distances from the primary. The median and the upper percentiles of the SFR/M* distribution remain almost unchanged, which is in contradiction with the data. We speculate that the conformity between low-mass, gas-poor central galaxies and their distant neighbours may be a signature of `pre-heating' of the intergalactic gas at an earlier epoch. The smaller scale conformity between high-mass, gas-rich central galaxies and their close neighbours may be a signature of ongoing gas accretion on to central galaxies in a minority of massive dark matter haloes.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the angular clustering of z ~ 2.3 distant red galaxies (DRGs) measured by Quardi et al. We find that, with robust estimates of the measurement errors and realistic halo occupation distribution modeling, the measured clustering can be well fit within standard halo occupation models, in contrast to previous results. However, in order to fit the strong break in w(θ) at θ = 10'', nearly all satellite galaxies in the DRG luminosity range are required to be DRGs. Within this luminosity-threshold sample, the fraction of galaxies that are DRGs is ~44%, implying that the formation of DRGs is more efficient for satellite galaxies than for central galaxies. Despite the evolved stellar populations contained within DRGs at z = 2.3, 90% of satellite galaxies in the DRG luminosity range have been accreted within 500 Myr. Thus, satellite DRGs must have known they would become satellites well before the time of their accretion. This implies that the formation of DRGs correlates with large-scale environment at fixed halo mass, although the large-scale bias of DRGs can be well fit without such assumptions. Further data are required to resolve this issue. Using the observational estimate that ~30% of DRGs have no ongoing star formation, we infer a timescale for star formation quenching for satellite galaxies of 450 Myr, although the uncertainty on this number is large. However, unless all non-star-forming satellite DRGs were quenched before accretion, the quenching timescale is significantly shorter than z ~ 0 estimates. Down to the completeness limit of the Quadri et al. sample, we find that the halo masses of central DRGs are ~50% higher than non-DRGs in the same luminosity range, but at the highest halo masses the central galaxies are DRGs only ~2/3 of the time.},

	Abstract = {We explore a possible origin for the puzzling anti-correlation between the formation epoch of galactic dark-matter haloes and their environment density. This correlation has been revealed from cosmological N-body simulations and is in conflict with the extended Press-Schechter model of halo clustering. Using similar simulations, we first quantify the straightforward association of an early formation epoch with a reduced mass-growth rate at late times. We then find that a primary driver of suppressed growth, by accretion and mergers, is tidal effects dominated by a neighbouring massive halo. The tidal effects range from a slowdown of the assembly of haloes due to the shear along the large-scale filaments that feed the massive halo to actual mass loss in haloes that pass through the massive halo. Using the restricted three-body problem, we show that haloes are prone to tidal mass loss within 1.5 virial radii of a larger halo. Our results suggest that the dependence of the formation epoch on environment density is a secondary effect induced by the enhanced density of haloes in filaments near massive haloes where the tides are strong. Our measures of assembly rate are particularly correlated with the tidal field at high redshifts z ~ 1.},
