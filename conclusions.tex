\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
In this paper we measure the clustering amplitude of the \Xray, \Radio, and \IR populations in the DEEP2 and PRIMUS fields.
We focus on these samples to identify a large range of specific accretion rate (Eddington ratio) sources to correlate environmental trends with respect to different accretion rates.
We measure the clustering strength of the \Xray sample relative to X-ray luminosity, specific accretion rate, hardness ratio subsamples.
We estimate the clustering strength of the radio-loud and put an upper bound on the radio-quiet samples.
We use WISE mid-IR to compare obscured and unobscured \Assef samples.
We quantify the relative clustering strengths between each sample, and  compared to stellar mass, star formation rate and redshift matched galaxy control samples.
The main results from our work are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

\item The inferred two-point auto-correlation function of \Xray, \Radio and \Donley sources to reside in different mass dark matter halos. 
From the two-halo term ($1<\rp/\hMpc<10$) we estimate that the \Xray, \Radio, and \Donley samples have median dark matter halo masses of 
\Mhalo{\sim}{13.3}, \Mhalo{\sim}{13.6}, and \Mhalo{\sim}{11.6}, respectively.

\item The \Xray sample clusters similarly to the \Radio sample.  Both are more ($\gtrsim$50\%; $\sim$2$\sigma$) clustered than the \Donley sample. The \Xray and \Radio samples are much more clustered in the one halo term as compared to the \Donley sample.

\item We find no significant correlations ($<$2$\sigma$) between the clustering amplitude and subsamples of the \Xray population with X-ray luminosity, specific accretion rate, and hardness ratio.
Trends with respect to stellar mass, star formation rate, and redshift are well within the expected trend for inactive matched galaxy control samples.

\item We find no significant difference in the clustering amplitude of  Radio-loud and all radio detected galaxies.
Since these samples probe different median redshifts ($z\sim0.5$ vs. $z\sim0.8$), we find that the radio-quiet sample to have a larger dark matter halo mass (\Mhalo{\sim}{13.6} vs. \Mhalo{\sim}{13.9}).

\item The \Donley and \Assef samples have similar clustering amplitudes.  For either we find no significant difference in the clustering amplitude of obscured and un-obscured \Assef sources.
This suggests differences found in angular clustering results are dominated by the uncertainty of the redshift distribution.

\item From the large range of specific accretion rates that the \Xray sample probes we can explain the bulk of the differences in clustering amplitudes found in the \Xray, \Radio, and \IR samples.
The high specific-accretion rate \Xray sources cluster more similar to the \Donley sample.
The low specific-accretion rate \Xray sources cluster similar to the \Radio sample.
This suggests that the environmental dependance on the different multi-wavelength AGN samples is sub-dominate on the scales that we probe $\gtrsim100\hKpc$.

\item The stellar mass, star formation rate, and redshift matched galaxy control samples are clustered similarly for the \Xray, \Radio samples.
The \Donley sample is less clustered than the matched galaxy control sample.
This may suggest contamination of the host galaxy light overpredicting the matched mass galaxy sample mass, and thus clustering amplitude.
